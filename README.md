## Browse compendiums

Moulinette Compendiums enables a more user-friendly and efficient way to navigate the content of FoundryVTT compendiums.
It automatically searches for all the content in locally installed modules and systems as well as from creators you support and that are available on the [Moulinette Cloud](https://assets.moulinette.cloud/marketplace/creators).
